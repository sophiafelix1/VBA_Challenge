# Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

# The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
# Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
